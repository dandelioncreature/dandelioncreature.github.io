My name is Rain and you have reached Dandelion Creature, my tiny diasporist judaica and queer art shop! Here you can find more information about my work and process. When I've finished setting up my online shop, that will also be accessible here. 

be sure to watch this space if you want to own weird objects that I've crafted with my grubby transgender paws
