Hello! My name is Rain and this is Dandelion Creature, my tiny diasporist judaica and queer art shop! Here you can find more information about my work and process. When I’ve finished setting up my online shop, that will also be accessible here.

A few of the weird objects that I've crafted with my grubby transgender paws are pictured below. I appologize for the current lack of image descriptions. This will be fixed in the future.
