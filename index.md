Rain is passionate about making physical, touchable art with his grubby transgender paws to share with the other beloved freaks of the world. He started learning to spin yarn eight years ago because of a love and fascination with wool as an artistic medium, and spinning tzitzit strings has been a treasured opportunity to use those skills to make ritual objects for other progressive Jews. His stoneware golem figures are an expression of the deep isolation, dissociation, grief, and love that he sees in the folklore figure of the golem.
