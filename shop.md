Plans for my online shop are currently on hold while I restructure my life and finances around living off disability income. This is a complicated process that will take a number of months. 

In the meantime I am open to potential art trades! Feel free to email me with whatever ideas you have.

You can also email to ask to be added to my list to be notified when my online shop is eventually up and running.
